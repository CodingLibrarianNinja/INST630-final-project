INST630 Final Project-To Do List


General

1)Figuring out what to do with payment

HTML

1) Images-need to take pictures of the following rings:
	-Blue Silver Ring
	-Black Copper Ring
	-Green Silver Ring
	-Pearl Silver Ring
	-Pink Copper Ring
	-Purple Copper Ring
	-Red Copper Ring
2) Upload ring photos



CSS

1)formatting the form

2)borders around photos

3)formatting links-not making them look so bland

4) A minor thing that I saw is that for the banner on the homepage, you have to scroll slightly to the right to see all of it. 
Could you please try and see if you can fit the banner on the homepage without having to scroll over by changing the CSS code?  
I think you would use width = 100%, but you can confirm with W3C Schools or another website to be sure-thanks!
