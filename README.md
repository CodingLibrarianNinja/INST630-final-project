INST630: Final Project PlanStephani MooreRosie Yanosko

Project Description: 

For our INST630 final project, we will be creating a website dedicated to selling handcrafted jewelry made by Stephani.It will contain finished jewelry pieces in addition to a jewelry form where potential customer can order a custom ring.This website will not actually accept payments, but the purpose of this project is to create a professional and interactive websitebased on the concepts and information from our INST630 class.

Basic Outline of Website:

1) HTML business homepage
2) HTML page with finished jewelry pieces that a customer can purchase
3) HTML page with the custom jewelry form
4) HTML page showing picture of customer's specific custom ring
5) HTML page confirming order
6) HTML page with cart that customer can put their purchases
7) HTML page confirming order
8) HTML page saying that their order has been completed
9) CSS file for all of the HTML pages
10) JavaScript file for mainly the form and custom ring photos

Goals for this website:

1) We want to have potential customers be able to see preview photographs of their jewelry.  More specifically, when they fill out the custom ring form, we will use JavaScript to have the corresponding image of their ring show up on the screen. (For example, if they selected a silver ring with a red stone, then they will see it on the screen before confirming their purchase.)
