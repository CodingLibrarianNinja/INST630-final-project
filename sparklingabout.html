<p>Stephani received her first official jewelry making lessons from her friend Melanie, a skilled jewelry designer, in 2009. 
In addition to Melanie's  lessons, Stephani also consulted online tutorials and books from her local library for beginner jewelry making patterns/tutorials.
As her jewelry making skills increased, friends and family started asking Stephani to design jewelry pieces for them.
Inspired by their encouragement, Stephani started an online Etsy shop and applied for her small business licence in December 2010.
She named her business "Sparkling Creations Jewelry" due to her love of bright colors and shiny beading materials!</p>
<p>Since 2010, Stephani has participated in almost fifteen craft fairs/festivals including the Dayton Autumn Celebration and various
shows at the Rockingham County Fairgrounds.  In addition, she sells her jewelry pieces on consignment at both the Hopkins Cabin in Massanutten
and the Silver Lake Mill in Dayton.  For up to date information about Stephani's business, go to the

<p>For the majority of her jewelry pieces, Stephani uses intermediate to advanced wire wrapped techniques to create them. Through manipulating the
wire, she can create a variety of jewelry pieces including rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and pendants.
In addition to wire wrapping the links, she completely handcrafts all of the clasps, ear wires, pendant frames, and other findings for her pieces. Only high
quality materials are used for each piece including tarnish resistant argentium silver/copper wire so her pieces will stay shiny longer than regular silver/copper. Other materials include Swarovski Crystals, natural gemstones,
and cane glass beads. Custom bridal and birthstone jewelry pieces are available upon request as well. Each unique handcrafted jewelry piece is perfect for any occasion!</p>
